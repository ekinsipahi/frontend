In general, you may need to have certain software or tools installed, such as:

* Node.js
* npm (Node Package Manager)

## Features

Each project has its own set of features and functionalities, which are described in the project's README.md file. Some of the common features that I've implemented in my projects include:

* *Responsive design using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind*
* *Building user interfaces with React*
* *Integrating charting libraries like Chart.js for data visualization*
* *Consuming APIs to display dynamic content*
* *Implementing form validation with client-side JavaScript*
* *Optimizing website performance using techniques like lazy loading and code splitting*

Please note that these projects do not cover authentication and authorization as their main focus. If you're interested in learning more about those topics, there are other resources and tutorials available that can guide you through implementing them in your frontend projects.
