## Introduction

This repository is a collection of frontend projects that I've built using various web development frameworks and tools. Each project has its own directory, containing its source code and related files. The goal of this repository is to showcase my frontend development skills and provide examples of my work.

## Naming Conventions
* ***Mini Project***: Projects that start with "Mini Project" are focused on HTML, CSS, and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
* ***Project***: Projects that start with "Project" are focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind

## Projects
This repository contains the following projects:

* **Mini Project 1**: A responsive Results Summary Component with Bootstrap Css.

## Installation

The installation process for each project may vary depending on its requirements. Please refer to the project's README.md file for detailed instructions on how to install and set up the project on your local machine.

In general, you may need to have certain software or tools installed, such as:

* Node.js
* npm (Node Package Manager)
* Yarn
* Git
* React

Again, please refer to the project's README.md file for detailed instructions on how to install and set up the project on your local machine.

## Usage

To start the project, navigate to the project directory and run:

`npm start` or `yarn start`

This will launch the project in your default browser.

If the project requires React, you may also need to run:

`npm install` or `yarn install`
to install the required dependencies before starting the project.

Again, please refer to the project's README.md file for project-specific instructions on how to run and use the project.

## Features

Each project has its own set of features and functionalities, which are described in the project's README.md file. Some of the common features that I've implemented in my projects include:

* *Responsive design using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind*
* *Building user interfaces with React*
* *Integrating charting libraries like Chart.js for data visualization*
* *Consuming APIs to display dynamic content*
* *Implementing form validation with client-side JavaScript*
* *Optimizing website performance using techniques like lazy loading and code splitting*

Please note that these projects do not cover authentication and authorization as their main focus. If you're interested in learning more about those topics, there are other resources and tutorials available that can guide you through implementing them in your frontend projects.


## Demo
Each project has its own demo, which can be accessed by visiting the project's live website or by running the project locally on your machine. The live website links are provided in the project's README.md file.
